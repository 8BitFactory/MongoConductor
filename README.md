MongoConductor is RESTful API server for MongoDB.  It is written in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), and utilizes [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).  Thanks to all these projects and many other that make this project possible.

##Installation
```
  git clone http://github.com/8bitfactory/MongoConductor.git
  cd MongoConductor
  npm install
  bower install
  node server.js
```
Depending on your environment you may need to change the http/https port (it's port 80 by default) configuration in settings.json or sudo the last command.  Once running you can browse to http://localhost and start configuring your server.
